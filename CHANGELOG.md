# Changelog

Notable changes to this fork. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); version numbers match the app's own versionName.

## [1.0.38] - 2026-05-31

A round of cleanup after reading the whole app against the ACC engine it drives. The headline: AccA no longer asks for access to your photos and media, and the config editor stops showing empty quotes and wrong toggle states.

### Removed
- The "Allow AccA to access photos, videos, music, and audio" prompt is gone. The app never read media; the permission was left over from an old storage approach. Profile export and sharing already work through the share sheet and a private file provider, so nothing needs it.

### Fixed
- The accd quick-settings tile now refreshes. It was waiting on a storage permission the app doesn't even declare, so the check always failed and the tile sat stale.
- Charging switch, apply_on_boot and apply_on_plug no longer show a literal `""`. ACC wraps these values in quotes; the app now unwraps them, so an unset switch reads "Automatic" again.
- The Apply on Boot / Apply on Plug toggles reflect whether a command is actually set instead of always showing on, and the plug row is labelled `apply_on_plug` to match ACC's real key.
- Reading the ACC config can no longer crash on any ACC version. Every older parser fell back to safe defaults the way the current one already did, instead of force-unwrapping a missing or empty field.

### Changed
- Version is now 1.0.38 (build 42).

## [1.0.37] - 2026-05-31

The Battery card was showing nothing real on ACC 2025.x — capacity stuck at -1%, voltage at 0.000 V, everything else blank or Unknown. This release reads the battery again.

### Fixed
- Battery info now parses ACC 2025.x output. ACC rewrote what `acca -i` prints: the old `CAPACITY=23`, `VOLTAGE_NOW=4100000` style became lowercase `level 23`, `voltage_now 4.10`, and so on. AccA only knew the old style, so every field fell back to its empty default and the dashboard looked dead. It now reads both. Older ACC still works because the old format is tried first.
- Voltage no longer shows as 0.004 V. AccA assumed the raw value was always millivolts and divided by 1000; on a build that already reports volts that turned 4.1 into 0.004. The scale is now picked from the value's magnitude, so it reads right whatever ACC sends.

### Changed
- Version is now 1.0.37 (build 41).

## [1.0.36] - 2026-05-31

This fork's first bug-fix release. The main reason it exists: AccA crashed on ACC 2025.x, and now it doesn't.

### Fixed
- Reading the charging config no longer crashes on ACC 2025.x. ACC renamed the `max_temp_pause` setting to `resume_temp`; older AccA force-unwrapped that field while parsing and threw a NullPointerException the moment it met the new config. The parser now reads every field safely and falls back to ACC's own defaults when a key is missing, renamed, or blank. Both the old and new key names are accepted.
- The quick-settings profile tile survives an empty profile list. Tapping it with nothing saved used to index past the end of the list and crash; now it does nothing.
- Boot no longer risks an ANR. The boot receiver ran root shell calls on the main thread, which could hang the system broadcast. That work moved to a background thread.

### Changed
- Applying a temperature profile writes `resume_temp` as well as `max_temp_pause`, so the control takes effect on old and new ACC alike.
- Version is now 1.0.36 (build 40).

### Build
- The CircleProgressBar widget is vendored into the source tree. Its jcenter artifact was pulled and jitpack could not build it, which left the project unbuildable.
- Fixed a layout attribute the vendored widget had renamed (`style` became `progress_style`), which was failing resource compilation.
- Added GitHub Actions. Every push builds a debug APK; tagging a release (`v*`) builds a signed APK and attaches it to a GitHub Release.
